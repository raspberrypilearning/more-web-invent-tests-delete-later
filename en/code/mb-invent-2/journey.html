                <p>I first got into Dungeons and Gragons as a teenager, when my physics teacher started a club to teach me and my friends how to play</p>

                    <h2>Our first games</h2>
                    <p>We would play every Thursday after school, Mr Stabillini, my two friends and I. The "games club" could continue long after we all left, in fact my little brother went to the same club 7 years later.</p>

                    <p>Next we took our love of TTRPGs and started playing at home, my best friend stepped into the role of a Dungeon Master and created a game for us to explore - these are some of my favourite memories.</p>

                    <p>I didn't play much during A-levels andn through University. A new version of D&D was released, 5th edition, and my friends and I decided to get back into this hobby we enjoyed so much as teenagers.</p>

                    <p>During lockdown, my friends and I were looking for ways to socialise and spend time together. Due to the growth of video communication platforms we were able to continue and even increase the number of D&D </p>

                    <p>With the help of technologies like Discord, D&D Beyond and Roll20 - playing online has only gotten easier. This means that we were able to create the holy grail of D&D - playing every week.</p>

                    <h2>Podcasts</h2>
                    <p>It was at this time that I got into various D&D Podcasts. My favourite is Not Another D&D Podcast - or NADDPOD for short. These shows helped reinforce my love of the storytelling inherent in games like Dungeons and Dragons. </p>

                    <p>After 3 and a half years of playing a campaign with a group of friends, we finally reached the finale. This was a 8 hour full day of playing, all sat around the same table. I had never finished a campaign before - they always fizzled out as people got busy - to see the end of the story was incredible.</p>

                    <p>I currently play two games a week - one campaign that has been going for almost 4 years, and a another that has only just started. D&D is my creative outlet during the week and I love it! </p>
